# Description
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom of the screen. The player can move left and right using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across the screen. If the player manages to shoot all the aliens, a new fleet appears, faster than the previous one. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
